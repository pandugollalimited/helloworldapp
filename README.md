# README #

Welcome to your [`REFCODES.ORG`](http://www.refcodes.org/refcodes) `archetype` based ` artifact`. This archetype has been generated by invoking the following command:

```
mvn archetype:generate \
  -DarchetypeGroupId=org.refcodes \
  -DarchetypeArtifactId=refcodes-archetype-alt-filter \
  -DarchetypeVersion=3.2.2 \
  -DgroupId=flipkart \
  -DartifactId=mobile-sale \
  -Dversion=version1
```

> Feel free to replace this `REDAME.md` file with some file of your own after having considered the below paragraphs.

### Getting started ###

To get up and running, you use this archetype together with [`Maven`](https://maven.apache.org). Just change into the newly created folder and invoke `mvn` to build your new application:

```
cd mobile-sale
mvn clean install
```

This will package your application into a [`fatjar`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19150811/what-is-a-fat-jar) which can be executed:

```
java -jar ./target/mobile-sale-version1.jar --help
```

When running a shell such as [`bash`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)) then first (and once only) make sure the shell scripts are executable by changing the according file attributes and then invoke the `build.sh` script, so finally you can launch your application from inside the `target` folder:

```
chmod ug+x *.sh
```

Using the `build.sh` script will create a self-contained executable shell script by automatically invoking the `scriptify.sh` script after a successful build (see further down below for more information on the `scriptify.sh` script).
In addition the `build.sh` script also will create self-contained binary executables by automatically invoking the `jexefy.sh` script, also after a successful build (see further down below for more information on the `jexefy.sh` script). 

> The `build.sh` script will finish off by printing out the actual paths and the names of the created executables.

```
./build.sh
./target/mobile-sale-launcher-x.y.z.sh --help
./target/mobile-sale-launcher-x.y.z.exe --help
./target/mobile-sale-launcher-x.y.z.elf --help
```

> In case your Artifact-ID `mobile-sale` contains a slash ("-"), then just the portion after the slash is used for your executable binary shell script's name.

### Self contained executables ###

To build self-contained single binary applications for Linux and Windows, go as follows:

```
./bundle.sh
./target/mobile-sale-bundle-x.y.z.elf --help
```

> In case your Artifact-ID `mobile-sale` contains a slash ("-"), then just the portion after the slash is used for your executable binary's name.

On Windows, execute the file `mobile-sale-bundle-x.y.z.exe` located in the `target` folder accordingly!

> The self-contained single binary applications (bundles) are generated by using [`Warp`](https://github.com/dgiagio/warp)!

### Windows installer ###

To build a Windows `mobile-sale-installer-x86_64-x.y.z.msi` installer, go as follows:

```
./installer.sh
```

Then launch the `mobile-sale-installer-x86_64-x.y.z.msi` installer located in the `target` folder to install your application alongside the bundled `JRE`.

> In case your Artifact-ID `mobile-sale` contains a slash ("-"), then just the portion after the slash is used for your installer's name.

### Jexefy JAR ###

To create a self-contained binary executable `mobile-sale-launcher-x86_64-x.y.z.elf` for Linux as well as `mobile-sale-launcher-x86_64-x.y.z.exe` for Windows, consisting of a bootstrap binary executable portion and the actual Fat-JAR file, go as follows (automatically invoked when calling `build.sh`):

```
./jexefy.sh
./target/mobile-sale-launcher-x86_64-x.y.z.exe --help
```

> On Linux, just invoke `mobile-sale-launcher-x86_64-x.y.z.elf` instead of the `mobile-sale-launcher-x86_64-x.y.z.exe` Windows variant. 

To run this self-contained binary executable, an installed `JRE` or `JDK` is required!

> In case your Artifact-ID `mobile-sale` contains a slash ("-"), then just the portion after the slash is used for your executable binary shell script's name.

### Scriptify JAR ###

To create a self-contained executable `bash` script `mobile-sale.sh` consisting of a bootstrap (`bash` script) portion and the actual Fat-JAR file, go as follows (automatically invoked when calling `build.sh`):

```
./scriptify.sh
./target/mobile-sale-launcher-x.y.z.sh --help
```

To run this self-contained shell script, an installed `JRE` or `JDK` is required!

> In case your Artifact-ID `mobile-sale` contains a slash ("-"), then just the portion after the slash is used for your executable binary shell script's name.

### Native image (GraalVM) ###

You may also create a native image using the GraalVM, feel free to skip steps 1) and 2) in case the provided sample files below `src/main/resources/META-INF/flipkart/mobile-sale` work for you! Assuming you are in the root folder of your project:

1) Dry-run your `JAR` to get the according native-image JSON configurations:

```
java -agentlib:native-image-agent=config-output-dir=target -jar target/mobile-sale-version1.jar
```

2) Copy the generated files and tweak (sample files have already been provided):

```
cp target/jni-config.json src/main/resources/META-INF/flipkart/mobile-sale/jni-config.json
cp target/proxy-config.json src/main/resources/META-INF/flipkart/mobile-sale/proxy-config.json
cp target/reflect-config.json src/main/resources/META-INF/flipkart/mobile-sale/reflect-config.json
cp target/resource-config.json src/main/resources/META-INF/flipkart/mobile-sale/resource-config.json
cp target/serialization-config.json src/main/resources/META-INF/flipkart/mobile-sale/serialization-config.json
```

3) Install GraalVM e.g. using [`SDKMAN!`](https://sdkman.io/) or install the [GraalVM](https://github.com/graalvm/graalvm-ce-builds/releases) manually

4) In case you installed the GraalVM manually, point the `GRAALVM_HOME` environment variable to your GraalVM base folder 

5) Then install the `native-image` tool for GraalVM

```
gu install native-image
```

6) On Debian install `build-essential`, `libz-dev` and `libfreetype6-dev` (in case of an "cannot find "-lfreetype" collect2: error"), on other distros do accordingly:

```
sudo apt install build-essential
sudo apt install libz-dev
sudo apt libfreetype6-dev'
```
   
7) Build with `Maven` using the `native` profile:

```
mvn clean install -P native-image
```

#### Additions for Windows ####

1) Install [Visual Studio Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/de/downloads), choose (check) all `C/C++` modules

2) Install the [GraalVM](https://github.com/graalvm/graalvm-ce-builds/releases)

3) Point the `GRAALVM_HOME` environment variable to your GraalVM base folder

4) Then install the `native-image` tool for GraalVM

```
gu install native-image
```

5) Copy the `native-image.exe` file accordingly to a location on you `%PATH%` for the `native-image-maven-plugin` for find this tool:

```
copy %GRAALVM_HOME%\lib\svm\bin\native-image.exe %GRAALVM_HOME%\bin
```

6) Build in the `x64 Native Tools Command Prompt` (as of step 1) for `Maven` to see the `C/C++` Tools using the `native` profile:

```
mvn clean install -P native-image
```
